[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3691977.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3691977)

This repo contains all data and code needed to re-do the analyses and figures in our manuscript

"Increased population density depresses activity but does not influence emigration in the snail *Pomatias elegans*" (Maxime Dahirel, Lo√Øc Menut, Armelle Ansart)

(link to bioRxiv preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.970160v1))

data in `txt` files are in the `data` folder, `R` as `Rmd`scripts in the `R`folder

Detailed information about the analysis and the contents of the `data` folder can be found in the `Rmd` document or the compiled `html` version.

This folder is a RStudio project folder, **and** the script uses the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/) (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)); the analysis should work on your computer no questions asked, whether you use the R project or not, no code line to change if you download the entire repo (you just need to install all the needed packages first, of course)
