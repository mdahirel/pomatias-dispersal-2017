# pomatias-dispersal-2017

This repo contains all data and code needed to re-do the analyses and figures in our manuscript

"Increased population density depresses activity but does not influence dispersal in the snail *Pomatias elegans*" (Maxime Dahirel, Loïc Menut, Armelle Ansart)

(submitted, link to bioRxiv preprint pending)

data in `.txt` format are in the `data` folder, `R` scripts in the `R`folder (both in `.R`and RMarkdown format; note that the `.R` file only contains limited comments)

Detailed information about the analysis and the contents of data folder can be found in the RMarkdown document or the compiled `html` version.

This folder is a RStudio project folder, **and** the script uses the [`here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/) (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)); the analysis should work on your computer no questions asked, whether you use the R project or not, no code line to change if you download the entire repo (you just need to install all the needed packages first, of course)
